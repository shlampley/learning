Overall:
Main:
Ask a User for inputs and display the game so that it is a PvP game only.
Stretch:
Design an algoroithim to play against.

Part 1:
Ask the user for inputs on grid locations:

A B C
# # # 1
# # # 2
# # # 3

A1 
 for example would put the choice here:
A B C
X # # 1
# # # 2
# # # 3

And then depending on whos turn it is Player 1 should be X then player 2 should be O.

Get the inputs and store them in an array and when the user inputs 'D' for the grid location stop asking and output the array contents.

Example:
Location: Value:
A1:X
A2:O
A3:X

Accomplish this by creating a TicTac Class that has the attricutes of grid_location and grid_value
Create getters and setters for these values. If you want to stretch yourself use @property instead of getter and setter.

Then create an array of TicTac objects. Then look into creating the __repr__ and __str__ methods so you can just say print(tictacobj) or similar without extra logic. https://www.journaldev.com/22460/python-str-repr-functions
